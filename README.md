[Spock](https://github.com/spockframework/spock) extension for [TestContainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java) library, which allows to use Docker containers inside of Spock tests.


# Usage

All annotations can be used on Feature as well as on Specification level.

## @Docker

You can use the annotation like this:

```groovy
@Docker(image = "nginx", ports = ["8080:80"])
class DockerExtensionIT extends Specification {
   // tests
}
```

You can also specify a field of type `DockerClientFacade` including a `@Shared` annotation which will be used automatically to inject the facade into the Specification.
Have a look into the included integration tests to see more examples.


## @DockerContainers

The `@DockerContainers` annotation can be used to define multiple containers.

```groovy
@DockerContainers(
        [
                @Docker(image = "emilevauge/whoami", ports = ["8000:80"], name = "first"),
                @Docker(image = "emilevauge/whoami", ports = ["9000:80"], name = "second")
        ]
)
class DockerContainersExtensionSpecAnnotationIT extends Specification {

    @Shared
    Map<String, DockerClientFacade> dockerClientFacades = [:]


    def "should start multiple containers"() {
        given: "a http client"
        def client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build()

        when: "accessing web server"
        def response1 = client.execute(new HttpGet("http://localhost:9000"))
        def response2 = client.execute(new HttpGet("http://localhost:8000"))

        then: "docker container is running and returns http status code 200"
        response1.statusLine.statusCode == 200
        response2.statusLine.statusCode == 200
    }  
}
```

## @DockerCompose

The `@DockerCompose` annotation can be used with regular `docker-compose.yml` files and should work even if docker-compose isn't installed locally.
Use the `shared` value of the annotation to define is the docker-compose environment should be shared between test runs. 

```groovy
 @DockerCompose(composeFile = "src/test/resources/docker-compose-uptime.yml", 
                exposedServicePorts = [@Expose(service = "whoami", port = 80)], shared = true)
 @Stepwise
 class DockerComposeSpecSharedAnnotationIT extends Specification {

 
     @Shared
     DockerComposeFacade sharedDockerComposeFacade
 
     DockerComposeFacade instanceDockerComposeFacade
 
     @Shared
     String lastHost
 
     def "running compose defined container is accessible on configured port"() {
         given: "a http client"
         def client = HttpClientBuilder.create().build()
 
         when: "accessing web server"
         def response = client.execute(new HttpGet("http://localhost:8080"))
 
         then: "docker container is running and returns http status code 200"
         response.statusLine.statusCode == 200
     }
}
```

You can also inject the internal ips and ports of the containers inside the docker network into you test specification.

```groovy 
@DockerCompose(composeFile = "src/test/resources/docker-compose-uptime.yml", 
               exposedServicePorts = [@Expose(service = "whoami", port = 80)], shared = true)
class DockerComposeSharedFieldAnnotationIT extends Specification {

    @Shared
    @DockerComposeServiceHost(service = "whoami", port = 80)
    String sharedWhoamiHost

    @Shared
    @DockerComposeServicePort(service = "whoami", port = 80)
    Integer sharedWhoamiPort

    @DockerComposeServiceHost(service = "whoami", port = 80)
    String whoamiHost

    @DockerComposeServicePort(service = "whoami", port = 80)
    Integer whoamiPort

    ...
}
```

## General TestContainers usage

See the [TestContainers documentation](https://www.testcontainers.org/) for more information about the underlying library.

# Setup
